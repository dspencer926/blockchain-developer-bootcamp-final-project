Blockchain project

A decentralized app that allows farmers/producers to connect with transporters, owners of spaces, and consumers, so that farmers/producers are always able to get their product to people who need it, regardless of circumstance, without the need for centralized distribution.

In the event that a supply chain breaks down, a service like this could circumvent the difficulties of dealing with centralized transportation services and centralized distribution centers.  For example, during COVID, many of the huge meat processing plants that supplied large percentages of the meat supply to consumers were unable to operate, thus leaving farmers unable to sell their livestock.  With a service like this, farmers would be able to either sell or slaughter their own livestock and get them directly to consumers without the need for a large middleman like Purdue.

Farmer has product that they are having difficulty selling due to problems with supply chain.  They post on this platform the product they have.  Consumers are able to purchase product and funds go into an escrow contract.  Once enough product has been reserved by consumers, a transporter can claim this shipment.  Transporter goes to retrieve product and will then deliver to customers.  Once transporter has claimed the product some amount of funds in the escrow will be released to the farmer.  As each delivery is made, a portion of funds are released to the transporter and additional funds are released to the farmer.  

1. Users will register themselves as producer, transporter, or consumer
2. Producer will be able to post a quantity of product with total price
3. Consumers will be able to pitch in any amount of money
4. Transporter will be able to claim product to transport it
5. Once product is delivered to consumer, the funds pledged by that consumer will be released from the escrow contract to the farmer and the transporter
